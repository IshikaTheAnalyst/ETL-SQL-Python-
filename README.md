# ETL-SQL-Python


In this project, I put together a full data analytics plan using Python and SQL. First, I used the Kaggle API to get the dataset I needed. Then, I cleaned up and organized the data using Python's Pandas library. After that, I moved the cleaned data into a SQL server. Finally, I used SQL to answer some interesting questions about the data.
